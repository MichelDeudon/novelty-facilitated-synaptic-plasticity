# Novelty-Facilitated Synaptic Plasticity

## Overview

Python implementation of [Dynamics of memory representations in networks with novelty-facilitated synaptic plasticity](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0896627306006386)

The model consists in an extended Hopfield Network with a Novelty Signal to store in and retrieve from memory morphed patterns.

## Requirements

- [Python](https://anaconda.org/anaconda/python)
- [Jupyter](http://jupyter.org/)
